🎥 Dynamic Quantum-Inspired Visualization of MetaQubit

This repository contains Python script for visualizing the stochastic evolution of MetaQubit, a self-referential stochastic quantum computing unit. The animation dynamically represents how entropy, coherence, tunneling, and state connections evolve over time.

🔬 What is MetaQubit?
MetaQubit is a self-referential stochastic quantum computing unit that dynamically filters vast search spaces, reducing them to a manageable scale without losing solutions. Unlike traditional qubits, MetaQubit incorporates stochastic intelligence and adaptability, allowing it to process exponentially more qualitative information.

This visualization showcases how MetaQubit organizes and adapts its state dynamically, proving its self-referential nature.

📌 What Does This Visualization Show?
The animation consists of two key sections:

1️⃣ Graph Representation (Left Panel)

Nodes (Quantum Units): Represent individual MetaQubit states.
🔴 Red nodes → State |1> (positive values).
🔵 Blue nodes → State |0> (negative values).
Edges (Connections): Represent relationships between MetaQubits.
Thicker edges indicate a larger state difference.
Green Points: Represent tunneling effects.
Higher tunneling probability results in larger and more visible green dots.
2️⃣ Metric Evolution Over Time (Right Panel)

📈 Entropy (blue line) – Measures system complexity.
🔄 Coherence (purple line) – Reflects how correlated qubits are.
⚖ Mean Weight (yellow line) – Average state connection strength.
🌉 Mean Tunneling (green nodes) – Probability of tunneling events.
👀 How to Interpret the Visualization?
🔹 Observe the dynamic adaptation of Mean Weight and Mean Tunneling in relation to entropy—this reveals how MetaQubit continuously adjusts its internal state.

🔹 Tunneling values are stochastic, meaning they change based on state shifts rather than being static, showcasing a key differentiator of MetaQubit.

🔹 The interaction between coherence and tunneling illustrates how the system reorganizes itself, proving its self-referential nature.

📌 Notes
🔹 This repository does not include the full MetaQubit source code—only the visualization script.
🔹 The visualization demonstrates MetaQubit’s stochastic intelligence and adaptability, reinforcing its self-referential nature.
